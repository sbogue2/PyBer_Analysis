# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate ride sharing data for a company called PyBer to help them gain insights into the profitability of their company. This project culminated in line graph to look at total fares by city type throughout the year of 2019.
## Results
There were many more rides and drivers in urban cities, and the overall fare amount was higher there. The average fare per trip was lower in urban cities, likely due to the amount of drivers available. The average fare per trip was highest in rural cities, likely due to the scarcity of drivers. Total fares were highest in urban cities and lowest in rural cities for all months throughout 2019.

## Summary
PyBer may struggle to maintain adequate number of drivers for rural city types in the future, due to low demand. PyBer should focus on finding ways to increase the popularity of their business in these cities.
