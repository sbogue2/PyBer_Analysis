# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate ride sharing data for a company called PyBer to help them gain insights into the profitability of their company. This project culminated in a line graph to look at total fares by city type throughout the year of 2019.
## Results
There were many more rides and drivers in urban cities, and the overall profitability was higher there. The average fare per trip was lower in urban cities, likely due to the amount of drivers available. The average fare per trip was highest in rural cities, likely due to the scarcity of drivers. Total fare profits were highest in urban cities and lowest in rural cities for all months throughout 2019. This is represented by the figure below:

## Summary
The vast majority of PyBer's business comes from urban cities, which isn't surprising due to the high population of urban centers. In 2019, 2,405 drivers took passengers on 1,625 rides in urban cities. This is in stark contrast to the 78 drivers taht took passengers on 125 rides in rural cities during that same time frame. Due to the lack of business in rural cities, PyBer may struggle to maintain adequate number of drivers in these city types. The reason for this is likely twofold: 1) there are less people requesting rides in these cities, resulting in less profits for drivers; and 2) average fare per ride is much higher in these rural cities as a result of so few drivers, resulting in less people willing to spend alot of money on ridesharing services. PyBer should focus on finding ways to increase the popularity of their business in rural cities to help increase the number of drivers.
